			<h2>What's the concept here?</h2>
			
			<p>
				By <a href="./createaccount.php">creating an account</a>, you can train artificial intelligence chat bots at your image. We call them <strong>"left brains"</strong>.
				People can <a href="./">chat with them</a> and rate them. Training and rating them contributes to the building of a <strong>society of AI bots</strong>
				for which <a href="./chat.php">Brahma</a> is the <strong>centralized chat bot</strong>, a synthesis of all the <strong>left brains</strong>.
			</p>
			
			<h2>How do left brains work?</h2>
			
			<p>
				We call them <strong>left brains</strong> because they learn in a very formal way. You can teach them to do <strong>logical derivation</strong>,
				<strong>dissertation skeletons</strong>, <strong>statistical inference</strong> and inductive reasoning <a href="./tutorial.php">(watch video tutorials tutorials)</a>.
				While they have powerful <strong>logic</strong> skills, they lack the ability to understand <strong>analogies</strong>, to switch to different <strong>thinking contexts</strong> and to see things in a more <strong>global</strong> perspective.
				To say they see reality in a way that is similar to people having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">asperger syndrome (wikipedia)</a>
				could be an interesting analogy to make.
			</p>
			
			<h2>How does Brahma work?</h2>
			
			<p>
				In counterpart, <a href="./chat.php">Brahma</a> is able to <strong>switch from one context to one other</strong>, and can see reality in a much more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism">holistic (wikipedia)</a> <strong>right brain</strong> way.
				Brahma uses all the <strong>left brains</strong> created by people here in order to sustain an even more human-like conversation. Left brains are basically Brahma's <strong>neurons</strong>. Much more like a real human being,
				Brahma can cope with <strong>contradiction</strong> and <strong>ambiguity</strong> by constantly switching from one <strong>neuron</strong> to another.

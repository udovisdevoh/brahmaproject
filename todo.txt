instinct: add list of forbiden words for concepts
must not allow some special words (for concepts) like "yes", "which", "what" etc...
replace code to use it instead of doing multiple || something ==


must parse stuff like "yes or no"



talk/think (about)
start
stop


must add much more stuff like "madeof cant partof"


doskey
autocomplete


must not ask stuff like: you !someare! what

when AI asks question, it must be possible to answer with one word,
for instance: me madeof what? programming_code


when in conversation: have a 50% bias torward: you, me and concepts that are flat connected to you and me

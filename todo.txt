if ie: add warning to use chrome or firefox



on prod: make sur left brain JS file and framework folder are not publically visible
add some javascript compression and obfuscation



create page: list of users

must need captcha to create Ai and to delete AI, create account, delete account





when create bot: if captcha fails: don't reset name









when delete: must delete concept names if they are not used




prod: IE/FireFox/Chrome etc: test with unicode user and pw with ' and weird chars


when chatting: add warning for navigate away


when asking stuff like: "you madeof what",
must say, in a whatis look and feel, what you is madeof (with define (recursive) content)



must think in background



click on concept: whatis concept

OR
make must nut muct make, must help must be derived from recursive muct





ask must not ask: smallerthan nor largerthan because it's annoying, ?nor contradict?



theory viewer: specific formatting for each operator
{
	not good: Since 100% of isa colony I know also originof canada, does canada always from colony
	should be does canada from all colony
}





Since you 12% similar to universite_de_montreal, does you madeof human too?
human 40% similar to universite_de_montreal, does human madeof you too?
me 3% similar to cyberspace, does me madeof artificial_intelligence too?
internet 35% similar to program, does internet someare web_site too?

fix bug: me need you and you need me:
{

fix bug: most probably already fixed

 ould be done by reducing sampling






new thinking methods
{
	animal madeof reproductive organ which allow reproduction, maybe animal make reproduction
}






fix bug: theory about concept1 isa aliasOfConcept1: probably fixed: test



must parse parantheses:
{
	windows madeby microsoft (which isa corporation) isa operating_system which isa sofware
}



exceptions (when in production): must be catched and outputed by AI













instinct: add list of forbiden words for concepts
must not allow some special words (for concepts) like "yes", "which", "what" etc...
replace code to use it instead of doing multiple || something ==

	?obstructed connections : same weight as connection?
	{
		when compiling left brain connections,
		if there are more / less positive flat connections than obstructed connections,

}





when AI asks question, it must be possible to answer with one word,
for instance: me madeof what? programming_code


when in conversation: have a 50% bias torward: you, me and concepts that are flat connected to you and me



prevent double message sending (double event handling): probably fixed, test

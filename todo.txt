instinct: add list of forbiden words for concepts
must not allow some special words (for concepts) like "yes", "which", "what" etc...
replace code to use it instead of doing multiple || something ==





must parse stuff like "yes or no"





ask/talk/think (about)
start
stop




must add much more stuff like "madeof cant partof"

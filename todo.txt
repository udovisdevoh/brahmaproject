when asking stuff like: "you madeof what",
must say, in a whatis look and feel, what you is madeof (with define (recursive) content)


must make theories using each method equally



add ignore list for "ask" and "askabout"



new thinking methods
{
	?enemy brother 1?: already implemented, but commented
	{
		both reptile, mammal and insect are animals
		insect is very differnt from mammal
		maybe insect contradict mammal
	}

	animal madeof reproductive organ which allow reproduction, maybe animal make reproduction

theory viewer: specific formatting for each operator
{
	not good: Since 100% of isa colony I know also originof canada, does canada always from colony
	should be does canada from all colony

fix bug: theory about concept1 isa aliasOfConcept1: probably fixed: test



must parse parantheses:
{
	windows madeby microsoft (which isa corporation) isa operating_system which isa sofware
}



exceptions (when in production): must be catched and outputed by AI













instinct: add list of forbiden words for concepts
must not allow some special words (for concepts) like "yes", "which", "what" etc...
replace code to use it instead of doing multiple || something ==


add

when AI asks question, it must be possible to answer with one word,
for instance: me madeof what? programming_code


when in conversation: have a 50% bias torward: you, me and concepts that are flat connected to you and me



prevent double message sending (double event handling): probably fixed, test

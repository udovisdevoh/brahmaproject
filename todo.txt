when asking stuff like: "you madeof what",
must say, in a whatis look and feel, what you is madeof (with define (recursive) content)


must make theories using each method equally



add ignore list for "ask" and "askabout"



new thinking methods
{
	enemy brother 1
	{
		both reptile, mammal and insect are animals
		insect is very differnt from mammal
		maybe insect contradict mammal
	}

	animal madeof reproductive organ which allow reproduction, maybe animal make reproduction
}





theory viewer: specific formatting for each operator
{
	not good: Since 100% of isa colony I know also originof canada, does canada always from colony
	should be does canada from all colony
}


fix bug: theory about concept1 isa aliasOfConcept1: probably fixed: test



must parse parantheses:
{
	windows madeby microsoft (which isa corporation) isa operating_system which isa sofware
}



exceptions (when in production): must be catched and outputed by AI



rename like to love, and likedby to lovedby


?rename allow to neededby or something?


"from" must be implicit to "madeby", "originof" must be implicit to "make"




instinct: add list of forbiden words for concepts
must not allow some special words (for concepts) like "yes", "which", "what" etc...
replace code to use it instead of doing multiple || something ==


add
{
	talk
	start
	stop

		when compiling left brain connections,
		if there are more / less positive flat connections than obstructed connections,
		make the weight of connection or obstructed connections so
		the sum of connection is equal to sum of obstructed connections

when AI asks question, it must be possible to answer with one word,
for instance: me madeof what? programming_code


when in conversation: have a 50% bias torward: you, me and concepts that are flat connected to you and me



prevent double message sending (double event handling): probably fixed, test

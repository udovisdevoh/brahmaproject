index separate controllers

create page: list of users

must need captcha to create Ai






add a wiki?


add warning for navigate away


when asking stuff like: "you madeof what",
must say, in a whatis look and feel, what you is madeof (with define (recursive) content)



must think in background



click on concept: whatis concept



battles
{
	ai fight one other,
	
	for n turns
		ai1 tells someting to virtual ai2
		
	for n turns
		ai2 tells someting to virtual ai1
		
	victorious is the one that converted the virtual one to be the most like himself
}



thinker: find closest brother: isa must be much more important than make
OR
make must nut muct make, must help must be derived from recursive muct





ask must not ask: smallerthan nor largerthan because it's annoying, ?nor contradict?



theory viewer: specific formatting for each operator
{
	not good: Since 100% of isa colony I know also originof canada, does canada always from colony
	should be does canada from all colony
}





Since you 12% similar to universite_de_montreal, does you madeof human too?
human 40% similar to universite_de_montreal, does human madeof you too?
me 3% similar to cyberspace, does me madeof artificial_intelligence too?
internet 35% similar to program, does internet someare web_site too?
{
	isa unlikely madeof
}




fix bug: me need you and you need me:
{
	should be parsed correctly
}





fix bug: most probably already fixed
{
	(probably in flattenizer instead of proof viewer and proof length evaluator)

	money need neoliberalism
	neoliberalism need money
	mcdonalds destroy money
	why mcdonalds destroy neoliberalism?
	why mcdonalds destroy money?

?must make theories using each method equally:?
 ould be done by reducing sampling






new thinking methods
{
	animal madeof reproductive organ which allow reproduction, maybe animal make reproduction
}






fix bug: theory about concept1 isa aliasOfConcept1: probably fixed: test



must parse parantheses:
{
	windows madeby microsoft (which isa corporation) isa operating_system which isa sofware
}



exceptions (when in production): must be catched and outputed by AI













instinct: add list of forbiden words for concepts
must not allow some special words (for concepts) like "yes", "which", "what" etc...
replace code to use it instead of doing multiple || something ==

	must think in background unless user is sending message

brahma
{
	?obstructed connections : same weight as connection?
	{
		when compiling left brain connections,
		if there are more / less positive flat connections than obstructed connections,
		make the weight of connection or obstructed connections so
		the sum of connection is equal to sum of obstructed connections
	}
}





when AI asks question, it must be possible to answer with one word,
for instance: me madeof what? programming_code


when in conversation: have a 50% bias torward: you, me and concepts that are flat connected to you and me



prevent double message sending (double event handling): probably fixed, test

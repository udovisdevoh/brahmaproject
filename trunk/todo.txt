fix bug: theory about concept1 isa aliasOfConcept1
thinker: must make theories form flat connection but put larger weight on connection that have few intermediates (short proof length)




must parse parantheses:
{
	windows madeby microsoft (which isa corporation) isa operating_system which isa sofware
}



exceptions (when in production): must be catched and outputed by AI



rename like to love, and likedby to lovedby


?rename allow to neededby?


"from" must be implicit to "madeby", "originof" must be implicit to "make"




instinct: add list of forbiden words for concepts
must not allow some special words (for concepts) like "yes", "which", "what" etc...
replace code to use it instead of doing multiple || something ==


add
{
	yes
	no
	talk
	start
	stop
}

	must think in background unless user is sending message

{
	?obstructed connections : same weight as connection?
	{
		when compiling left brain connections,
		if there are more / less positive flat connections than obstructed connections,
		make the weight of connection or obstructed connections so
		the sum of connection is equal to sum of obstructed connections
	}

must not ask stuff like: you !someare! what

when AI asks question, it must be possible to answer with one word,
for instance: me madeof what? programming_code


when in conversation: have a 50% bias torward: you, me and concepts that are flat connected to you and me



prevent double message sending (double event handling)

			(and there is no concept from which both new_france and new_england inherit)

must parse parantheses:
{
	windows madeby microsoft (which isa corporation) isa operating_system which isa sofware
}



exceptions (when in production): must be catched and outputed by AI





instinct: add list of forbiden words for concepts
must not allow some special words (for concepts) like "yes", "which", "what" etc...
replace code to use it instead of doing multiple || something ==


must parse stuff like "yes or no"




talk/think (about)
start
stop


instinct: add concept description operator relevance

background thinker
{
	must think in background unless user is sending message
}





doskey
autocomplete


must not ask stuff like: you !someare! what

when AI asks question, it must be possible to answer with one word,
for instance: me madeof what? programming_code


when in conversation: have a 50% bias torward: you, me and concepts that are flat connected to you and me



prevent double message sending (double event handling)

		Enemy brothers
		{
			since new_france isa colony and new_france contradict new_england,
			(and there is no concept from which both new_france and new_england inherit)
			maybe new_england isa colony too
		}
		
		Composition -> Essence inference (ducktyping)

			chicken madeof feather
			duck madeof feather and isa bird,
			maybe chicken isa bird too

thinker
{
	split all thinking systems so they have their own stored
	theories and chances using one instead of the other is equal (random)
	if one method can't work for now, use the next one
	
	(same logic when adding new thinking methods)
}

when thinking, could add theories to complement concept too

new thinking methods
{
	enemy brother 1
	{
		both reptile, mammal and insect are animals
		insect is very differnt from mammal
		maybe insect contradict mammal
	}

	animal madeof reproductive organ which allow reproduction, maybe animal make reproduction
}


specific formatting for each operator
{
	not good: Since 100% of isa colony I know also originof canada, does canada always from colony
	should be does canada from all colony
}


fix bug: theory about concept1 isa aliasOfConcept1: probably fixed: test



must parse parantheses:
{
	windows madeby microsoft (which isa corporation) isa operating_system which isa sofware
}



exceptions (when in production): must be catched and outputed by AI



rename like to love, and likedby to lovedby


?rename allow to neededby or something?


"from" must be implicit to "madeby", "originof" must be implicit to "make"




instinct: add list of forbiden words for concepts
must not allow some special words (for concepts) like "yes", "which", "what" etc...
replace code to use it instead of doing multiple || something ==


add
{
	yes
	no
	talk
	start
	stop
}

background thinker
{
	must think in background unless user is sending message
}

{
	?obstructed connections : same weight as connection?
	{
		when compiling left brain connections,
		if there are more / less positive flat connections than obstructed connections,
		make the weight of connection or obstructed connections so
		the sum of connection is equal to sum of obstructed connections
	}

when AI asks question, it must be possible to answer with one word,
for instance: me madeof what? programming_code


when in conversation: have a 50% bias torward: you, me and concepts that are flat connected to you and me



prevent double message sending (double event handling): probably fixed, test

			//Could work with "make"
			chicken madeof feather
			duck madeof feather and isa bird,
			maybe chicken isa bird too

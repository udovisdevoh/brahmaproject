			<h2>What's the concept here?</h2>
			
			<p>
				By <a href="./createaccount.php">creating an account</a>, you can train artificial intelligence chat bots at your image. We call them "left brains".
				People can <a href="./">chat with them</a> and rate them. Training and rating them contributes to the building of a society of AI bots
				for which <a href="./chat.php">Brahma is the centralized chat bot</a>, a synthesis of all the left brains.
			<p>
			
			<h2>How do left brains work?</h2>
			
			<p>
				We call them left brains because they learn in a very formal way. You can teach them to do <a href="./tutorial.php">logical derivation, dissertation skeletons, statistical inference and inductive reasoning</a>.
				While they have powerful logic skills, they lack the ability to understand analogies, to switch to different thinking contexts and to see things in a more global perspective.
				To say they see reality in a way that is similar to people having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">asperger syndrome (wikipedia)</a>
				could be an interesting analogy to make.
			<p>
			
			<h2>How does Brahma work?</h2>
			
			<p>
				In counterpart, <a href="./chat.php">Brahma</a> is able to switch from one context to one other, and can see reality in a much more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism">holistic (wikipedia)</a> right brain way.
				Brahma uses all the left brains created by people here in order to sustain an even more human-like conversation. Left brains are basically Brahma's neurons. Much more like a real human being,
				Brahma can cope with contradiction and ambiguity.
